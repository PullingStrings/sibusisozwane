This is just a site where you can find out more about myself and what I did and can do.

Please have a look and get in touch if you are intersted to work with me



I’ve worked in the performing-arts sector over the years, from social media monitoring, coordinating live music events and curating visual art exhibitions in Southern and Eastern Africa mostly.

Travelling between countries and continents, I often used my laptop to create personal sites for musicians and artists. To create these portfolios, I was using website builders.

They were expensive to maintain and limited regarding the scale of creativity and customisation for myself and ultimately the client. This is why, I decided that I would like to build my own website from start to finish.

Due to the limited resources and technologies back home in South Africa, I then moved to London and joined GA. I fully immersed myself in the web development community to unlock my potential in the digital sphere.

After discovering the various paths in web development, I learn and admire the fact that you can work in teams as a developer (like joining a band again). Getting my feet wet in front-end development is where I would like to start my journey with the possibility to later on jump back into back-end development to become a well rounded full-stack developer.

A web app that lets you find playlists from people around you.
https://playgenfinder.herokuapp.com/

Built with: 	ReactJS, Express, Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose
		HTML5, SCSS, WEBpack

This was an individual project, that came to mind because I travel quite a lot and find listening to music is calming and relaxing but can also get boring...and so this app allows you to find users in any area you are in and lets you follow their playlists built using React JS and Express as the backend, you will be able to login using Spotify and find music anywhere you are.

Project-3

This was a group project built to help pet owners to locate and find their lost pets. I did most of the styling for the whole app with advice from my team members using CSS and AngularJS.

Project-2
# Learn to dance mzansi
A fun web app that teaches you how to dance on different styles of music from all around the world starting with Southern Africa.

This was an individual project. I have used EJS together with jQuery and Ajax as a front end tool to create a very slick looking web app that teaches you how to dance. Fully RESTful you can login and logout securely and upload videos that are kept in the database that I created from scratch using MongoDB and Express.
